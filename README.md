# EXPO-LIVRES

### Project
EXPO-LIVRES is an annual book-fair held by La Boutique du Livre where Manitoban librarians peruse and order many books for their organizations and schools.

This app enables customers to create a virtual "cart" by scanning barcodes with their device's camera. The "cart" is then uploaded during checkout, significantly speeding up checkout times.

### Technology
EXPO-LIVRES uses native Apple technologies including Swift 2.0, Core Data, and a custom barcode scanner I built using the iOS SDK.
